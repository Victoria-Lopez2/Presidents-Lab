                <h2> George Washington</h2>

                <p> George Washington was an American soldier, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. He was unanimously elected by the Electoral College in the first two national elections and remains the only president to have been elected unanimously. </p>
                
                <p> Washington established many vital presidential precedents, including the use of the title "Mr. President" and a two-term limit, which later became the 22nd Amendment. His leadership during the Revolutionary War and his commitment to democratic principles set the standard for future leaders. </p>
                
                <p> Washington is revered as the president who set the standard for those who followed him, by serving the nation with dignity and intelligence. He famously refused a third term, establishing a peaceful transition of power that would become a hallmark of American democracy. </p>
                
                <p> His farewell address in 1796 warned against political parties and foreign entanglements, advice that continued to influence American foreign policy for generations. Mount Vernon, his Virginia plantation, remains a testament to his legacy. </p>
