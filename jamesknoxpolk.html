                <h2>James Knox Polk</h2>
                <p>James Knox Polk was the 11th president of the United States, serving from 1845 to 1849. He previously was the 13th Speaker of the House of Representatives and ninth governor of Tennessee. A protégé of Andrew Jackson, he was a member of the Democratic Party and an advocate of Jacksonian democracy.</p>
                
                <p>Polk is known for his aggressive expansion of American territory. During his presidency, the United States acquired Oregon (through the Oregon Treaty with Britain) and won the Mexican-American War, which resulted in California and the Southwest becoming U.S. territories.</p>
                
                <p>Despite serving only one term, Polk accomplished all of his major platform promises, including the establishment of an independent treasury system and the reduction of tariff rates. He is considered one of the most effective presidents in terms of achieving policy goals.</p>
                
                <p>Polk's presidency marked a significant territorial expansion of the United States, nearly doubling the nation's size through the acquisition of western territories. He chose not to seek re-election and retired to his Tennessee home, where he died three months after leaving office.</p>
