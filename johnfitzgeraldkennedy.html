                <h2>John Fitzgerald-Kennedy</h2>
                <p>John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States, serving from 1961 to 1963. He was the youngest man elected to the office and the youngest president to die in office. Kennedy represented Massachusetts in both houses of Congress before becoming president.</p>
                
                <p>On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, shocking the nation and the world. His death marked a turning point in American history and led to widespread mourning across the country. He remains one of the most beloved presidents in American history.</p>
                
                <p>During his brief presidency, Kennedy launched the Peace Corps, advocated for civil rights legislation, and initiated the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon. His famous speech at Rice University declared "We choose to go to the Moon."</p>
                
                <p>President Kennedy presided over what many called "Camelot" - a period of optimism and cultural change in America. He was followed by Lyndon B. Johnson, who continued many of Kennedy's initiatives, particularly the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
